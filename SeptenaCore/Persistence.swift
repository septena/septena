/// at `~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.septena.cloud/Library/Application
/// Support/Septena.store`. macOS 15 guards `~/Library/Group Containers/*`
/// behind the App Data TCC service (`kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAppData`), and the

/// sets `com.apple.security.app-sandbox`. So every launch raised "Septask
/// would like to access data from other apps", and the grant did not stick:
/// tccd recorded it and prompted again on the next launch of the same,

///
/// `~/Library/Application Support/Septena/` was the first answer and it was
/// WRONG — macOS also guards a per-app subdirectory of Application Support
/// under the same App Data service, and a folder called "Septena" is another
/// app as far as Septask (`com.septena.tasks.mac`) is concerned. Opening the
/// store is the first thing either app does, so the prompt came back on every
