// The spike's task list (see SeptaskKitWindow.swift for scope): a native
// NSTableView over LocalCache's ordered DTOs, writing through TaskMutator.
// Selection, arrow keys, type-select, and every shortcut below run on the
// synchronous responder chain — the feel being evaluated against SwiftUI.
//
// Structure matches the SwiftUI list: Today (setting-gated, default on) and
// Anytime group open tasks under area / project headers in sidebar order —
// loose tasks first, then each area (direct tasks, then its projects), then
// loose projects (`orderedFromGroupedOpen` in TaskListView is the reference).
// Flat Today sorts by due urgency instead, per the same setting's contract.
//
// Keyboard map — same bindings as `TaskRowShortcuts` (TaskCommands.swift),
// so the two shells never teach conflicting muscle memory:
//   ↑/↓, ⇧-arrows, type-select, Home/End — native NSTableView
//   ⌘K — toggle complete          ⌘T — toggle Today
//   ⌘N — new task in this list    ⌘, — settings
//   ⌘R — bare rename via the field editor (Esc cancels)
//   Return, double-click — inline composer on the title (Return / Esc fold it)
//   ⌘↩ — notes: opens the composer straight into notes; from inside notes it
//        commits and folds. ↓ on the title's last line drops into notes.
//   ⌘⌫ — delete (soft; lands in Recently Deleted)
//   ⌥⌘M — file into the suggested list (the "→ Suggested" capsule's pick)
//   Space — deliberately unbound (the "Space completes the task" trap);
//           the checkbox refuses first responder for the same reason.
