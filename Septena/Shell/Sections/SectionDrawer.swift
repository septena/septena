// the right idiom per surface:
//
//   • compact width (iPhone)        → modal `.sheet` (unchanged native idiom)
//   • regular width (iPad / macOS)  → docked `.inspector` trailing pane, so
//     the list/log stays visible and editing a record never covers the
//     context the user was just looking at.
//
// Convert a section's `.sheet(item:)` / `.sheet(isPresented:)` to the
// matching `.adaptiveDetail(...)` and it inherits coherent behavior on all
// three surfaces — no per-section size-class branching.
//
// Dismissal: a docked inspector is NOT a "presentation," so the inner
// form's `@Environment(\.dismiss)` is a no-op there. The primitive injects
// `\.adaptiveDetailClose`; edit forms should close through that (it falls
// back to `dismiss()` when absent, so a form still works if presented as a
